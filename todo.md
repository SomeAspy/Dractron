# Dractron ToDo

- Better certificate verification
- Find why `window.opener` (and other functions on `window`) are undefined in electron specifically, but not in the browser
- Figure out what goes in place of `ipAddr` in the KVM link.
- Figure out if other values in the KVM connection string need changing
- Start up credentials page? Or some other way to make it so credentials are not a config file
